    "Html": "Hello,\r<br />\n<br />\nI've been using version 1.2 for a project and recently had the need to add this same functionality to another project, so I grabbed version 1.4 and started using, but noticed that when performing the transform almost all the formatting is removed from the transformed file. I say almost because comments/commented nodes are still formatted properly. Version 1.3 does keep the formatting as well, so I'll use that for the time being.\r<br />\n<br />\nThanks for the great tool.<br />\n",
