    "Description": "<p>Hello, Denis</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>You have grate extra feature to share same parameters between different transformations but I think more useful and obvious is too share sections using configSource. For example using some flag like &quot;/include&quot; on ctt exec, ctt should include configSource linked xml on source file (not real source but it&#39;s temp copy) before transformation also with transformation.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>I was sure that Microsoft have already implement it, and looked across TransformationTask in Reflector, but after searching stackoverflow I found that out of the box we just have one inconvenient way to get params from xml on deploy (http://sedodream.com/2012/05/13/VSWebPublishHowToParameterizeConnectionStringsOutsideOfWebconfig.aspx).</p>\n",
