    "Description": "I'm attempting to use your tool (which is *exactly* what I need) on a successful build.  I downloaded it into the Common7\\IDE\\Tools folder, but VS keeps saying the command, \"C:\\...\\Tools\\ctt.exe ...\" exited with code 9009.  I have tried using the built-in macros to fully qualify all file references but it doesn't seem to make a difference. What am I possibly doing wrong?",
